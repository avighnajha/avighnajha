Hey! I'm Avighna, a second-year physics undergraduate at Imperial College London. I am mainly interested in Web development and data science and currently trying to get better at data science through Python and Javascript in general. I'm looking to participate in hackathons over the rest of the year to build my coding profile and experience. You can reach out to me through my email: avighnajha1703@gmail.com.
